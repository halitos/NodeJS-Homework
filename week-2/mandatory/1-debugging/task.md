# Debugging Practice

We've hosted some Servers on Glitch but they're not quite working properly. Could you fix them for us?

- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice1

* - "/quotes and /quotes/random" are working now after fixing errors LINK ==> https://halit-debugging-practice1.glitch.me

- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice2

* - search query is functional now after changing first GET "quotes/:id" path to "/quotes/quote/:id" as it was getting the first match path LINK ==> https://halit-debugging-practice2.glitch.me

- https://glitch.com/~debugging-practice3

* - This was trying to sending status directly inside send(). Changed to res.status(200).send("msg) it works now.

## Start by remixing our example server

- [ ] Make sure you're logged in to https://glitch.com/
- [ ] Remix each example
- [ ] Name your new server `yourname` + NAME_OF_EXERCISE
- [ ] Check that it is working by making a request to `/`
- [ ] Fix the code on your version of the server
